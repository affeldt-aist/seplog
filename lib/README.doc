Small extensions to the standard libraries of <a href="https://coq.inria.fr" target="_top">Coq 8.8</a> and <a href="https://math-comp.github.io/math-comp/" target="_top">SSReflect/MathComp</a>. 

They sometimes overlap with standard libraries but still provide new features. 
machine_int provides a formalization of finite-length integers (int : nat -> Type).
finmap provides an original formalization of finite maps.
Also contains Hoare-logic modules for a while-like
language and a language with gotos (<span class="quotation">[Ando
